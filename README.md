# Snake Game Project
# Introduction: 
Snake game is a classic game that offers a simple and fun experience. The player controls a snake that must avoid obstacles and itself as it grows, providing a relaxing way to play

# Data Structures Used:
2D Array (bg[][]): representing the game grid. <space><space> Arrays (x[], y[]): storing coordinates of snake segments.  Point Class: for storing coordinates of food.

# Algorithms Implemented:
Snake Movement: logic for updating the snake's position based on user input.  Collision Detection: algorithms to check if the snake collides with itself or game borders.  Food Placement: algorithm for randomly placing food (apples) on the game grid.

# Game rule:
The blue dot represents the food and the snake is red.   The player presses the “Space” button to start playing.  The player must use 4 movement buttons to control the snake in up, down, left, and right directions to eat food.  Each time the player eats the food, they will receive points. When the snake reaches a certain length, it will increase the player's level and the snake's movement speed.  The game ends when the snake's head touches its body. At this point, you will see the score and level you have played. The game is restarted and the player presses the “Space” button
